# Catalog Of My Things (Ruby Capstone Project)

## Introduction

### About the project

> In this **group project**, we created a **console app** that helps the users keep a record of different types of things they won: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything is based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data is stored in JSON files but we will also prepared a database with tables structure analogical to the app's class structure.

### User Stories

 As a user:

   * I can list my items (books, music albums, movies, and games)
   * I can add new items to my catalog (books, music albums, movies, and games)
   * I can checks all the labels, genres, authors and sources of my items
   * I can exit the program from the menu
   * I can see the data I previously saved every time I run the app
   * [BONUS] I have a nice UI with colors in the console.
